# QHacks2018-FacialRec
This was the code we used for the Queen's Hackathon, QHacks 2018.

This code was used on multiple different pieces of hardware. It operated a facial recognition door lock, which took your picture, and authenticated your identity with Microsoft Azure. If the face had security clearance, the dragonboard would be SSH'd into and it interfaced with an arduino board to activate the motor that controlled the door.

It is ugly, it is hacked, poorly commented, unintuitive but it worked and won us top 5 out of 100 teams, so I'm gonna leave it here.
